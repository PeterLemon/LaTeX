LaTeX Documentation Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with MiKTeX.<br />
http://miktex.org<br />
I use the portable version of MiKTeX which you can find here:<br />
http://miktex.org/portable<br />
I have included the output of all the documents in PDF format.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Krzysztof Kowalczyk, for making the Sumatra PDF reader.<br />
A free high quality & fully featured portable PDF viewer:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single document (DOCUMENTNAME.pdf) file.<br />
1. Using MiKTeX: Run TeXworks<br />
2. File/Open DOCUMENTNAME.tex (Make sure you have copied "/images" directory & Fonts)<br />
3. Change the box next to the "Play Button" from "pdfLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTeX" to "XeLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTeX"<br />
4. Press the "Play Button" to compile the PDF document.<br />
(You will be prompted to automatically download & install libs if MiKTeX is fresh, just let it install what it needs to compile)<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
MiKTeX has an inbuilt PDF viewer that displays compiled results, but you can view the PDF files using any viewer.<br />
I use the Sumatra PDF reader to view documents, which I highly recommend.<br />
