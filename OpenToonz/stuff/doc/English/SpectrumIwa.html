<h4>● Overview</h4>
Depending on the brightness of the input image, it has the effect of outputing a rainbow color pattern like a thin film interference.<br>
Real iridescent glare is not a thin film interference, but you can get likely results for the glare of the material.

  <h4>● Input port</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Source</b> : Connect the input image. The brightness of the input image, corresponds to the thickness of the thin film.<br>
Thin film thickness is how bright the brightness will be, brightness 0.0 is the "Thickness Min" which will be described later, brightness 1.0 will correspond to the "Thickness Max".</LI>
<LI><b>Light</b> : Connect the light image.<br>
If the light image is connected, there is less of a difference in the output.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Alpha channel of output results, will be replaced in the alpha channel of the light image.</LI>
<LI>If the "Light Threshold" parameters described below are enabled, you can output the image of the light image & the rainbow colors for screen synthesis.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Intensity</b> : The intensity of the light. Rainbow-color image will be brighter when it is set higher.</LI>
<LI><b>Refractive Index</b> : The medium refractive index. Rainbow-color image will be brighter when it is set higher.</LI>
<LI><b>Thick(ness) Max</b> : The maximum value of the thin film thickness. This corresponds to the film thickness of the brightness 0 portion of the input image.</LI>
<LI><b>Thick(ness) Min</b> : The minimum value of the thin film thickness. This corresponds to the film thickness of the brightness 1 portion of the input image.</LI><br>
※ Thickness can also take a negative value. In that case, the film thickness is calculated as if the negative part is 0.<br>
※ Thickness of Min, Max, can also reverse the magnitude of the value. In that case, the rainbow colors of the pattern is reversed.
<LI><b>R/G/B Gamma</b> : Used as a gamma correction value for each of the RGB channels, of the rainbow color pattern.</LI><br>
<LI><b>Lens Factor</b> : The gamma correction value that can be added to when outputting a rainbow color pattern from the input image brightness.<br>
As a result, for example, for the concentric pattern, you can put a strain, such as through a convex/concave lens for the period of the rainbow.</LI>
<LI><b>Light Threshold</b> : When the light image is connected, you can combine the screens of the light image & the rainbow color image.<br>
Light Threshold is the minimum value of the alpha channel of the light image required for the screen synthesis.<br>
For each pixel, it will be performed with the following processing.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>When the alpha channel of the light image is following the Light Threshold ： Screen synthesis does not take place.</LI>
<LI>When the alpha channel of the light image is 1 ： Light image screen is synthesized at 100%.</LI>
<LI>When the alpha channel of the light image is larger than the Light Threshold, & less than 1 ： The proportion of the screen synthesis is linear interpolation.</LI>
</UL>
The higher the value of the Light Threshold the brighter the output image will become, a smaller screen ratio makes the writen image become larger. You can also make it a negative value.
