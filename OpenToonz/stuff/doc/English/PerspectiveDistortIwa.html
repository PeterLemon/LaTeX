<h4>● Overview</h4>
This effect is for generating the movement of the ground at the time of Follow (Front Moves Fast, Back Moves Slow = Motion Parallax).<br>
Since the deformed trapezoid is stretching the picture to the left & right, there is no vertical distortion.<br>
In other words, the contraction in the vertical direction by the depth must be incorporated in the pre-input image.<br>
Also, if you want to apply this effect to the background to parallel move, the movement of the background must be folded into the SubXsheet.<br><br>

<h4>● Input Port</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Source</b> : Connect the input image.</LI>
</UL>

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Vanishing Point</b> : The center point at the time of deformation. Used by perspective projection which is based around the vanishing point.</LI>
<LI><b>Anchor Point</b> : The point that determines the criteria of the vertical position of the deformation. Pixels above this point will not be drawn (Becomes Transparent).<br>
In addition, a picture with a horizontal line passing through this point, does not change in size.</LI>
<LI><b>Precision</b> : Since the deformation is carried out only by expansion, the resolution will fall. In order to maximize the resolution of deterioration,<br>
deform by calculating the input image in advance by a factor of this value with a finer resolution.<br>
There is no sense to increase the Precision more than the value obtained by dividing the "Capture Resolution of Background" by the "Output Resolution".</LI>
