<h4>● Overview</h4>
This effect is for generating a Perlin noise pattern with depth on a horizontal plane.<br>
Not only is there the usual noise pattern, there is also a mode in which the output is used as an offset reference image for inoWarpHVFx,<br>
when the noise pattern is used for the height of a water surface with waves, you can select a mode to output the Fresnel reflection intensity<br>
of the water surface as seen from the camera.

<h4>● Parameters</h4>
<UL>
<LI><b>Mode</b> : Specify drawing mode. There is a choice of the 4 following modes.</LI>
	<UL>
	<LI><I>Noise</I> : Draw a Perlin noise pattern. To calculate the noise value for each sample point which is 1 pixel divided by 100.</LI>
	<LI><I>Noise (no resampled)</I> : Draw a Perlin noise pattern. Because it does not perform the sub-pixel processing it achieves high-speed results, but it is irregular near the noise pattern horizontal line.</LI>
	<LI><I>Warp HV offset</I> : When the noise pattern of the water surface goes high & low, the light reflected by the surface of the water is shifted a lot in the horizontal/vertical direction,<br>
	it is used to draw what was expressed in the Red Channel/Green Channel, respectively.<br>
	Warp HV Fx Ino "Hori", is used by connecting to the "Vert" port, you can reproduce the distortion of the reflection of the surface of the water in its own way.<br>
	By using the "Wave Height" parameters, you can adjust the shading degree of the pattern.<br>
	※ Warp HV Fx Ino "Hori" port, requires a conversion of the channel. Because it refers to the Red Channel of "Vert", in the "Vert" port side, & in the Channel Selector Fx, etc.</LI>
	<LI><I>Fresnel reflectivity</I> : When the noise pattern of the water surface goes high & low, it outputs to the Fresnel reflection intensity of water surface as seen from the camera in the shade.<br>
	The reflection intensity of the camera frame from the lower side when brightness is 0 will appear normalized.<br>
	By using the "Wave Height" parameters, you can adjust the shading degree of the pattern.</LI>
	
</UL>
<LI><b>Size</b> : Specify the size of a 1 second generation of the random noise pattern.</LI>
<LI><b>Evolution</b> : Specify the deployment of 1 second generation of the random noise pattern.</LI>
<LI><b>Octaves</b> : Specify how many generations will be synthesized in the random noise pattern.</LI>
<LI><b>Offset</b> : Specify the offset position of the random noise pattern of 1 generation.<br>
The camera is rightward positive on the X-axis, the camera depth direction is positive in the Y-axis.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Intensity</b> : On the current generation, specify the intensity ratio of the noise pattern for the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Size</b> : On the current generation, specify the size ratio of the noise pattern for the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Evolution</b> : On the current generation, specify the ratio of the deployment cycle of the noise pattern for the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>p_Offset</b> : On the current generation, specify the offset ratio of the noise pattern for the next generation.</LI>
<LI><b>Fov</b> : The vertical angle of the camera view is specified in degrees.<br>
When the angle of view is large, perspective is emphasized (Wide Angle), when the angle of view is small, the perspective will be compressed (Telephoto).</LI>
<LI><b>Eye Level</b> : Specify the position of the vanishing point for the camera (Horizontal Line).</LI>
<LI><b>Alpha Rendering</b> : Specify whether the intensity value of the noise, will also be stored inside the alpha channel.</LI>
<LI><b>Wave Height</b> : When the noise pattern of the water surface goes high & low, specify the difference between the maximum height position of the wave & the minimum position of the noise.<br>
It is only valid for "Warp HV offset" mode & "Fresnel reflectivity" mode.</LI>
