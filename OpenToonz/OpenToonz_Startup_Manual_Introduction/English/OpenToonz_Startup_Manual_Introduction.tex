\normalsize
\noindent The Stuff folder houses various settings of OpenToonz. If more than one user is working on the\\
 same project, creating a shared Stuff folder in the data directory, can unify project settings\\
and work from a common color sample data set.\\
Inside the Stuff folder, there are several additional sub-folders as follows:\\
- cache: Image cache data is temporarily stored here\\
- config: Contains the style sheet, various configuration files, such as the translation file\\
- fxs: This is where the effect preset parameters are saved\\
- library: Pre-prepared material such as video content or audio samples imorted into OpenToonz\\
- profiles: Work environment settings, etc. will be saved here for each user\\
- projects: Project configuration files are saved here\\
- studiopalette: Global color swatch palette, shared by the entire project will be saved here\\
These folders can be moved in the following way even after installation.\\[0.4em]
\par
\large
\noindent ● To change the path of the Stuff folder, etc. (Windows) \normalsize \colorbox{fontpink}{\color{black}Advanced Level}\\
※ With administrator privileges do the following.\\
① Press the Windows key + R, type “regedit" in the “Run" dialog, \& then run it.\\
② The Registry Editor will now open.\\
③ In HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE$\backslash$SOFTWARE$\backslash$OpenToonz$\backslash$OpenToonz$\backslash$1.0, the path to each folder is\\
stored, rewrite the one you want to change using the following key:\\[-1.0em]

● To Work Without Creating a Project\\

Project based Data Management, can shorten the workload, such as with the stored material inside\\
the file path “+drawings", it is possible to simplify the data management, also there is a big\\
advantage to having default project values set for a common scene.\\
On the other hand, in case of use such as when performing finished outsourced work, such as\\
dealing with small amounts of data from a variety of scenes, the advantage of summarized data for\\
each piece is small, it would be inconvenient to create a project for each one. In such a case,\\
without creating a project, please work by using the Default Project “sandbox". The User Project\\
Folder of the project that was created \& any Scene Files stored outside of the sub-folders, are\\
recognized as belonging to the sandbox Project, the user can also proceed without using a project.\\
